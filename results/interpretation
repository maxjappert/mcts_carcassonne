- UCT and uct-tuned 0 are shit, the highest win margins happen for exp-term 0
- boltzmann 2 is better than boltzmann 5
- ucttuned 5 is better than ucttuned 11
- uct 5 better than uct 3
- ucttuned4 is better than ucttuned 12
- boltzmann 1 is better than 6
- boltzmann 8 is better than 3
- boltzmann 10 better than 7
- uct 3 better than uct 7, 14
- uct 3 is better than 7

=> the results somehow don't make any sense, every term is about as good as all the other terms
